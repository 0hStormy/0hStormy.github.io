# Intro

0Trumpet is a trumpet soundfont that I recorded and put together myself, I would say it's decent enough for basic things concidering it's free.

# Why

Because I couldn't find many good trumpets online that were free, and also it's hard to sight read so this makes it easier to have trumpets in your song.

## But SWAM exists >:(

Yes, I am aware of SWAM and do like the SWAM Trumpet. But this isn't meant to be a big thing like SWAM, it's just meant to be a good free (no pirating needed) way of putting trumpets in your music.
