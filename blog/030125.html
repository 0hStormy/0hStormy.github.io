        <h1>Some music for Gingerbug - 3/1/25</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <p>
              Hey! It's been a hot minute since I've updated my website.
              But I'm back with some music for a game I'm working on!
            </p>
            <p>
              Me and my friend Ren have been working on a game together.
              Ren has been doing most of the programming and art while I'm doing the music and some other things.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's a little summary of what the game is about: 
              <blockquote>
                Explore and survive the Gingerbug Isles, their depths, their seas and their skies.
                Build a fort alone or with friends, fight the beasts across the land,
                and defend your home from coordinated attacks with a variety of weapons,
                vehicles and war machines, all while sustaining yourself and your technology.
              </blockquote>
