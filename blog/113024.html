        <div class="box">
            <p>So, I got bored and remade my website. I felt like this was need for a few reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>My website was getting messy behind the scenes</li>
                <li>It didn't work on older web browsers or proxy's</li>
                <li>I wanted to try using pure HTML for a website</li>
                <li>I just needed something to do</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I will try to also be more active on my website in terms of posting things, I really don't want this one to be like the rest and turn into a ghost town. You may still read old updates by going back to the main updates page and clicking "Gimme old updates".</p>
