In my opinion I think the light mode looks pretty cool. In addition to the the light theme I added **6 new songs** to the music page, which you should really go listen to. I aslo added ways of contacting me if needed on the <a href="about.html">about</a> page. Finally, for a full changelog, go check the commit page on my <a href="https://github.com/0hStormy/0hStormy.github.io/commits/main/">github</a> page. AdiÃ³s Amigos!
