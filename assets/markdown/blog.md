## Little update - 10/4/24

It's been a while since I've talked here. I have been focused on school mainly, I have been working on music a little bit, but don't expect a new music dump for a while. I've hit a bit of a roadblock with RIFT, I'm now on the "make it good" stage of RIFT where I need to make the program a lot less badly coded and also make it more intuitive.

I hope you all have a good day!

## How to Linux update and RIFT website! - 8/29/24

So How to Linux has gotten an update, I have added information about NixOS and the Nix package manager and also reworded and fixed typos. It should be live as soon as the Updates page goes live.

I also have a website for RIFT now with a cool logo to go with it! It has info about the program and where to download it, along with documentation. You can check out the website at https://openrift.github.io/

In my opinion I think the light mode looks pretty cool. In addition to the the light theme I added **6 new songs** to the music page, which you should really go listen to. I aslo added ways of contacting me if needed on the <a href="about.html">about</a> page. Finally, for a full changelog, go check the commit page on my <a href="https://github.com/0hStormy/0hStormy.github.io/commits/main/">github</a> page. AdiÃ³s Amigos!
