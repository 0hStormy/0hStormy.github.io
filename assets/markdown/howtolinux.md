# Desktop Environment

The desktop environment is what makes your comuter have a nice graphical interface, most operating systems have them. Some common desktop environments on Linux include Gnome, KDE Plasma, XFCE, and Cinnamon. Here is what the following look like:

These images show the defaults of each of the desktop environments. In reality, you can customize these desktops as much as you want to make it work for you. In the end, just look around and see which one is your favorite.

# Distrobutions

A distrobution, or distro for short, is a version of a Linux that company, group, or a single person makes with a specific package manager, desktop environment, and set of applications to make it unique from the rest. Some popular distro's include: Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, Debian, and Arch.

For beginners, generally Debian based distrobutions such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint are a good start, although feel free to start with anything, I just recommend these because they work well by default and are a little easier to setup.

# Installing Applications 

There are a couple ways to install software on Linux

## Software Center

Most popular Linux distros these days have a software center installed to install applications with ease, some examples of software centers include Gnome Software and KDE Discover.

## Package Manager

You can also install software, or packages as they're also known in the terminal with a package manager such as `apt`, `dnf`, and `pacman`. As an example, you could do `sudo apt install firefox`, or `sudo pacman -S rust`.
