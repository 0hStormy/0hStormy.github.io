# Haii!

I'm Stormy, and welcome to my website,
this is where I will post updates on different things on this little wbesite of mine.

He/Him or They/Them are fine and I am <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@0Stormy">Aromantic Asexual</a> <img width="20" class="flag" src="assets/Aroace_flag.png">

I do many things in life currently. Including school, creating music, drawing, and some programming. I currently know Python, HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Rust.

## Current state of this website
Currently, you can check out this home page to get to know me a bit more. You can also go check out my music <a href="music.html">here</a>. There is also my blog which talks about updates to this website, my music, projects I'm working on, and just general things. And finally you can go look at the about page which has credits mainly, which are pretty boring but I don't want anyone to get mad at me for not creditting them.

There is also a projects page which had some things I'm currently working on. It'd be pretty cool if your checked those projects out. :)
