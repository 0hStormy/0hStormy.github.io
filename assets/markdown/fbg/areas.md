# Areas

There are quite many different areas to explore in Funny Border Game 2.

<hr>

## Desertia

Desertia, known as "The Ancient Desert" is the oldest of all the areas, and also is generally not a great place to live as the economy is not great and food is hard to find at times. Cooking is the main way of getting food as ingredients are easier to obtain than fully cooked meals.

## Jungle Town

Jungle Town, known as "Land of Opportunity" is the only place you can travel to from Desertia. Jungle Town has a lot of things to do including farming, mining, fishing, and more! Food is easy to get and you can travel to sky islands pretty easily [WIP].

## Kala'Mayorka Cavern

Kala'Mayorka, also known as "The Former Geyser's Dried Source" is probably one of the first caves you will encounter in the game is is a tall and slim cave that mostly has Flaeren to find.

## Mishko Town Cavern

Mishko Town Cavern, also known as "The Destroyed Village in The Buried Forest" is the biggest cave to explore with many different types of ores to mine. It used to be town thousands of years ago but is now just ruins of what it once was.

## North Desertia Sinkhole

The North Desertia Sinkole, also called "A Small Sanctuary" is a small sinkhole that is found in Desertia. This sinkhole is very lush and you may even find some loot if you're lucky!

## South Desertia "Sinkhole"

The South Desertia "Sinkhole" is less of a sinkhole and more of a tiny little cave, there is not much to do there but I will say it mayb useful for uhh... How do I say this, "Trading Items" yes that's the word!
