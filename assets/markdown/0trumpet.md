# Intro

0Trumpet is a trumpet soundfont that I recorded and put together myself, I would say it's decent enough for basic things concidering it's free.

# Why

Because I couldn't find many good trumpets online that were free, and also it's hard to sight read so this makes it easier to have trumpets in your song.
