# Picking a Fedora Version

Since Linux is an open platform, you can either choose from the mainline Fedora Workstation or the many Spinoffs that have different Desktops on them. The Spinoffs are the exact same besides what desktop they use and slighly different pre-installed software. I will give a small list of the most popular versions of Fedora.

### Fedora Workstation (Main Version)

Fedora Workstation is the version of Fedora you'll se when you go on Fedora's website. It uses the Gnome desktop environment which has unique workflow tailored to workspaces and have a simple interfrace by default that can be extended if needed. Gnome can be modified with extensions, you can read more about them on Gnome's extension <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/about/">page</a>.

Fedora KDE Plasma is the first Spinoff on the list. It features the Plasma desktop environment which by default has a more Windows 7/10 interface while still being very customizable, most customization features are built into Plasma. You can read more about Plasma on their <a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/">website</a>.

### Fedora XFCE

Fedora XFCE is another popular Spinoff, it uses the <a href="https://xfce.org/">XFCE</a> desktop enviornment which is lightweight, so older PC's will have no trouble running it. Fedora's theme for XFCE looks pretty dated, but XFCE is quite customizable and you can make it look as modern or as classic as you want.

### Fedora Cinnamon

The last Spinoff I will be featuring is Fedora Cinnamon! Cinnamon is made by the <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint team</a> and has a very Windows like look by default. Fedora ships icons that look dated, but Cinnamon has a lot of built-in customization options to explore.

## Conclusion

If I were you, don't stress too much about which version you pick, I would pick the version you think looks the coolest or what you would most likely want your desktop to look like. And remember, Linux is a very customizable ecosystem and all of these Spinoffs can be customized.
